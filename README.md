# terminal-art
generate pixel art inside the terminal

## Concept:
This is a program that will print pixel art images to the terminal. By using ANSI escape sequences for colors and ASCII UTF-8 encoded characters, we can print out boxes to the terminal and color them to produce images.

## Next steps:
- [ ] Add more colors
- [ ] Input colors and image from another file
  - consider a PPM or CSV file as input
- [ ] Add the ability to save / export to a separate file. 
  - This wouldn't look good if it wasn't exported to a terminal, due to the ANSI escape colors.
